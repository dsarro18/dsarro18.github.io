    <h1>Unconditional Surrender</h1>

      Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of NYC pending an eleventh-hour political earthquake, and even then, his campaign appears unstoppable.
      </p>

      <p>
      Where does his appeal lie?
      </p>

      <p>
      It is insufficient to proclaim that “NYC is brainwashed” or “Foreigners hate America” as a valid reason that he will gain close to or exceed 50% of the vote in a three-way race.
      </p>

      <p>
      The root of his appeal comes from a decades-long smear campaign against the wrong actors which, ironically, is the core of President Trump’s appeal as well.

      Progressivism has rallied against billionaires, religious institutions, rule of law, cultural absolutism, and Western exceptionalism - regardless of the after-effects on society. This is intentional, not because of sophisticated four-dimensional chess, but rather brute-force tribalism seeking a resulting society that maximizes ideological success over the individual’s and community’s prosperity.
      </p>

      At its heart, the message is to “blame someone else” in order to avoid the moral bankruptcy that emerges from this way of thinking. It also allows for the charade to continue indefinitely without repercussion since there is always someone to inculpate from the side of the “oppressed.”
      </p>

      <p>
      Mamdani is everything wrong with the 21st century wrapped into one person. He defends failed policies such as rent freezing, city-owned grocery stores, elimination of public safety, embracing of third-world religious values, and tax increases on the ever-growing minority of taxpayers while simultaneously blaming the Constitution, the Jewish community of NYC, Republicans, Christians, gun owners, MAGA, Libertarians, moderates, pro-police groups, Democrats… if the group is to his right, they deserve condemnation.

      The most dangerous threat to America remains individuals who are educated by Western advancement and possess heightened intellect yet embrace Saul Alinsky’s <em>Rules for Radicals</em> as their gospel. Their ideas rely on preying on the most vulnerable with no intention of solving any of the structural problems under the guise of “racial equity” or “social justice,” more ideas and movements consummated with ethical depravity.

      Welcome to the modern world.
