      The Mamdani Effect<br>
      Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of NYC pending an eleventh-hour, political earthquake, and<br>
      even then, his campaign appears unstoppable.<br>
      Where does his appeal lie?<br>
      It is insufficient to proclaim that “NYC is brainwashed” or “Foreigners hate America” as a valid reason<br>
      that he will gain close or exceed 50% of the vote in a 3-way race.<br>
      The root of his appeal comes from a decades-long smear campaign against the wrong actors, which<br>
      ironically, is the core of President Trump’s appeal as well.<br>
      Progressivism has rallied against billionaires, religious institutions, rule of law, cultural absolutism,<br>
      Western exceptionalism, etc. regardless of the after-effects on society. This is intentional, not because<br>
      of sophisticated, 4-dimensional chess but rather brute-force tribalism seeking a resulting society that<br>
      maximizes ideological success over the individual’s and community’s prosperity.<br>
      At its heart, the message is to “blame someone else” to avoid the moral bankruptcy that emerges from<br>
      this way of thinking. It also allows for the charade to continue indefinitely without repercussion since<br>
      there is always someone to inculpate from the side of the “oppressed”.<br>
      Mamdani is everything wrong with the 21st century wrapped into one person. He defends failed policies<br>
      such as rent freezing, city-owned grocery stores, elimination of public safety, embracing of 3rd world<br>
      religious values, and tax increases on the ever-growing minority of taxpayers while simultaneously<br>
      blaming the constitution, the Jewish community of NYC, Republicans, Christians, gun-owners, MAGA,<br>
      Libertarians, moderates, pro-police groups, Democrats…. if the group is to his right, they deserve<br>
      condemnation.<br>
      The most dangerous threat to America remains individuals who are educated by Western advancement<br>
      and possess heightened intellect yet embrace Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals as their gospel. Their<br>
      ideas rely on preying on the most vulnerable with no intention of solving any of the structural problems<br>
      under the guise of “racial equity” or “social justice”, more ideas and movements consummated with<br>
      ethical depravity.<br>
      Welcome to the modern world. do not change my words, and title this unconditional surrender
