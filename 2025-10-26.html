      <h1>Advancement</h1>
      <p><em>October 26, 2025</em></p>

      <p>Does anyone still do their company’s accounting by hand?<br>
      What about watching a transistor television?<br>
      Or owning a cell phone without internet access?<br>
      Outside of a few very, very aged individuals, the answer is NO, and why would you?<br>
      As society “progresses” through the 21st century, only those wishing to be left behind fail to embrace the latest technology. Advancement. Efficiency. Innovation.<br>
      Yet the paradox is how destructive this progress truly is.<br>
      The software that automates your accounting erases the very calculation and analysis skills that once made you competent.<br>
      Your new ultra-HD television delivers crystal-clear SLOP, an endless feed of hollow films and shows.<br>
      Your smartphone opens every corner of the digital world while closing off genuine human connection.<br>
      Those who refuse to embrace this self-destruction perish faster than those who accept it.<br>
      Would you like to plunge to your death in fifty feet, or one hundred?<br>
      The choice, as always, is yours.</p>
