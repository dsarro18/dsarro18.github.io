  <h1>In Defense of the Heart</h1>

  <p>The essential element of human drive is passion.</p>

  <p>We ponder the value of both the material and abstract world, a constant comparison. The divide between them revolves around the feeling of sentiment. A common misconception is the opinion of superiority relating to abstract causes (love, peace, wisdom) placed against material goods (technology, furniture, alcohol). On the surface, there is absolutely no difference between the two. That is for religion to decipher.</p>

  <p>What drives every decision is the feeling of desire. What will one truly go through for love? Or happiness? Or success? This is not measured by numbers or rationale but rather the passion behind decisions.</p>

  <p>Discourse highlighting how the “brain is right” is harmful and absorbs the most important part of human activity: emotion. In an ideal world, both the heart and mind are synchronized perfectly like an orchestra. But this is not reality.</p>

  <p>The heart’s desire and passion for both material and abstract concepts results in a more intriguing and unique world. It is then up to the brain to decode the aftermath.</p>

  <p>Let life happen. Allow your passions to shine through. The heart knows what it wants.</p>
