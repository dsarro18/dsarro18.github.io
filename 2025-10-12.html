<h2>Instant Gratification</h2>
<p>Can humanity point to the precise moment when our expectations shifted from building to receiving?</p>
<p>I’m referring to the cornerstones of life I have listed in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business</li>
  <li>Politics</li>
  <li>Career Development</li>
  <li>Religion</li>
  <li>Family Structure</li>
  <li>Sports</li>
</ul>
<p>The list could go on infinitely, far beyond my limited coding skillset.</p>
<p>Take politics, for instance, through this sentence outline:</p>
<blockquote>“I expected (insert politician / party) to have solved this problem by now! I voted for them so where is the action?!?”</blockquote>
<p>Or in sports:</p>
<blockquote>“This (insert owner / general manager) has had five years to win the championship! Enough is enough!”</blockquote>
<p>Two competing ideologies emerge from these examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Expectation of Reward</li>
  <li>Abbreviated Time Horizons</li>
</ol>
<p>The simultaneous yet conflicting nature of gratification and time has produced a global society sprinting toward its own extinction.</p>
<p>Instant profits. Quick skillsets. Fast-tracked morality.</p>
<p>Each accelerant chips away at what’s left of ethical, long-term, morality-driven civilization.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of patient, scalable, sustainable growth, the kind that once yielded rewards beyond the dopamine rush of immediacy.</p>
<p>And there is no turning back.</p>
