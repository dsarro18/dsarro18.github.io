      <h1>In Defense of Kafka</h1>
      <p><em>August 14, 2025</em></p>

      <p>Anyone exploring the depths of philosophy should listen to <em>Philosophize This!</em>, hosted by Stephen West. It’s one of the most accessible ways to build an understanding of key figures, concepts, and ideas while also developing the vocabulary needed to articulate your own beliefs.</p>
      <p>Several episodes cover Camus (whom I admire but fundamentally disagree with) as well as other philosophers whose ideas are placed side by side for comparison. One episode in particular focuses on Kafka’s critique of absurdism and his views on the outsourcing of morality that feel increasingly relevant in today’s world.</p>
      <p><strong>Kafka’s argument can be distilled into three key points:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Morality is outsourced to government, schools, and institutions, which we allow to dictate our belief systems.</li>
        <li>This outsourcing erodes free will, creating a “control state” where compliance replaces conviction.</li>
        <li>The loss of individual moral agency renders society meaningless, as people become disconnected from the act of choosing what is right.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Over the past 15–20 years, society has grown more dependent on external structures to define morality. It’s easier to legislate behavior than to persuade others through dialogue. But this convenience comes at a cost: we increasingly judge others through the lens of societal power structures rather than engaging in the critical thought required to form our own ethical conclusions.</p>
      <p>This trend is not just lazy, it’s dangerous and immoral! It betrays the intellectual legacy of those who fought for reason, freedom, and human agency. To live life on autopilot is to surrender the very thing that makes us human.</p>
      <p><strong>Can society be saved? Is there a system that can allow individuals to discover morality without bias?</strong></p>
      <p><em>In 2025, that may be the most difficult question of all.</em></p>
