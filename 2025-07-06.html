  <h1>Moderation</h1>

  <p><strong>Who is moderating content?</strong> You often hear about learning from YouTube, Google, ChatGPT, News Media, but where is the confirmation that information is both 1) accurate and 2) efficient?</p>

  <p>Let’s take YouTube for example. Any topic known to man is accessible. Want to fly a small plane? How about a house renovation question? Or what about dribbling a basketball with 1 finger?</p>

  <p>The bigger challenge is to find content that <em>isn’t</em> accessible.</p>

  <p>This means that content creation relies on two primary factors for survival:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Original ideas. Good luck in an oversaturated market. Better odds at taking old ideas and repackaging them in a slightly different manner, getting enough views to make some money. Repeat.</li>
    <li>Faking content for attention. This includes false information or exaggerating the content — both rely on deception.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Number 2 remains much more prevalent. How many videos on YouTube are exactly as described? How many cast doubt on what your own eyes can see and observe?</p>

  <p>In addition, whose job is it to verify? YouTube removed dislikes, they remove comments, and they make deals with creators even if they know that creator is bending the rules. Fair or foul?</p>

  <p>Apply this concept to ChatGPT or Google. Can the population be trusted to decipher what is real or accurate? Sure, I can add 2+2 and know that it is 4, but what about when I ask it to help me understand the Odyssey’s subliminal messaging? Sure, I can read the book but that is already a translation and edited book from its original.</p>

  <p>This all results in the fundamental question: <strong>is all content falsified?</strong> Are we returning to the last edited version? Or the real thing — if it exists at all?</p>
