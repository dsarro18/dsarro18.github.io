  <h1>Introductory Manifesto</h1>
  <p>[This will serve as a whiteboard to discuss whatever topic is on my mind. There will be no focus on grammar as if I were going to publish the work. The format and typography of both the website and blog post will merely encompass the minimum requirements to ensure the work stays organized. All thoughts will be my own, but it is vital that someone attempts to provide a framework for a subset of society that, quite frankly, is unable to counteract a growing “microcosm” in an intelligent, well-thought-out manner. 
That “microcosm” represents the side of Progressivism (not to be confused with Liberalism) that is growing more prevalent with each passing day. As a disclaimer, this blog will not be solely “political” but rather will discuss facets of political ideology, social sciences, athletics and competition, business and technological advancement, entertainment and cinema, and economic theory. The good news is 99.9% of human history relates to the above topics so no discussion is omitted. 
Each post will also be under 500 words. Anything worth arguing must be clear, concise, cunning, and convincing. 1500 words on any topic is reserved for school papers and academics, neither of which this blog will focus on.
“Pick and Choose Morality”, the center of current societal discourse that runs rampant on social media, will often be the bind that relates the above topics together.
