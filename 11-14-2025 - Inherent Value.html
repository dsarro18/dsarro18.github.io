  <h1>Inherent Value</h1>
  <em>November 14, 2025</em>

  <p>The modern struggle in the 21st century is the challenge to find objects that provide real, inherent value.</p>

  <p>Maybe this is an oxymoron in such that objects are vessels masquerading as entities with self-merit. The iPhone, local schoolhouse, newspaper, or childhood home act as objects with the potential to provide safety, knowledge, connection, etc.</p>

  <p>Does this mean we should disregard their role in shaping society? No, but there should be a clear distinction over what their true self-worth is.</p>

  <p>Take a holiday vacation for example. The hotel, airplane, food, tourist sites, and time away from work are all great vessels to experience life but collectively require human intervention to transition from vessel to valuable.</p>

  <p>Younger generations are mistakenly valuing these objects at the expense of psychological emotions such as love, connection through shared experience, frustration, determination, and yearning. All of this is amplified by technology invading every corner of society’s routine.</p>

  <p>A society that idolizes vessels becomes a society worth nothing.</p>
